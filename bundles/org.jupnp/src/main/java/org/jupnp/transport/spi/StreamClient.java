     * <li>If the request expires because the timeout has been reached, log at <code>INFO</code> level.</li>

     * outgoing HTTP request, even if the given
     * {@link org.jupnp.model.message.StreamRequestMessage} does not contain such a header.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This method will add the <code>User-Agent</code> HTTP header to the outgoing HTTP request if
     * the given message did not already contain such a header. You can set this default value in your
     * {@link StreamClientConfiguration}.
     * </p>

     * @param message The message to send.
     * @return The response or <code>null</code> if no response has been received or an error occurred.
